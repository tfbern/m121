# Visual Studio Code Configurations
This directory contains various configurations for Visual Studio Code and its extensions.
## Tasks *tasks.json*
These are Visual Studio Code tasks. 
The file defines a default build task, which will be called by pressing *Ctrl+Shift+B*.

## Start *launch.json*
This will run the application when pressing *Ctrl+F5*.

## Microsoft C/C++ IntelliSense *c_cpp_properties.json*
This is the configuration file of the Microsoft C/C++ IntelliSense extension.
Basically, we need to tell IntelliSense where the libraries are located at, so it can check the code.
